        <h2>Akan-Name-Generator</h2>
             <p>In the vibrant culture of the Akan people in Ghana, your name is more than just a label—it’s a "soul name" known as Kradin. This tradition dictates that a child’s first name is determined by the day of the week they were born. Each day carries its own unique spirit and set of character traits. Use this generator to discover your Ghanian identity and the traditional meaning behind your birth day.</p>
